# Base

Knowledge base template for Jekyll.

Base was orignally made by [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), the Cloud CMS for Jekyll. Some features has been added to make it suitable to be used as a senseBox Knowledge Base.

## Features

* Tutorials organised by category
* Two types of tutorials - text and video
* Ability to have a "tutorial series"
* FAQ section
* Sticky sidebar for main headings in tutorials

## Setup

1. Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`.
2. Add your Google Analytics, Disqus and MailChimp keys to `_config.yml`.
3. Get a workflow going to see your site's output (with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) or Jekyll locally).

## Develop

Base was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.4.3, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

## i18n

The master contains the german version of the docs and serves [https://docs.sensebox.de]. English is stored in the `EN` branch and serves [https://en.docs.sensebox.de].

### Post Series
To create a new series:

* Add a new document to the `sets` collection.
* Set the `title` and `description`.

To add a tutorial/post to a series:
* Add a `set` field to the tutorial front matter which points to the file name of the desired set without the `.md` extention. e.g. If I have a set at `_sets/getting-started.md` I would use this in my tutorial front matter: `set: getting-started`.
* Add a `set_order` field to the tutorial front matter and specify a number. This is the tutorials order in the set.

The set will be displayed as the following
